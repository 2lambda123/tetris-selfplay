# tetris-selfplay
The aim is to create a self playing game Tetris. Currently the master branch contains a user playable game of Tetris with no self playing functionality.
The pygame module is used for both displaying to screen and user input, and text is displayed in the font [FairFax](https://github.com/kreativekorp/open-relay/tree/master/Fairfax).
